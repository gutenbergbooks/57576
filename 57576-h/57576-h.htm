<p class="dropcap">In Political Computations, the
following Principles are universally
allowed.</p>

<p>That the Riches of every
Country arise from the Natural
Produce of the Earth;
and the Labour and Art, imployed in improving
the same.</p>

<p>That the Quantity of Native Commodities,
the Source of Riches, is in Proportion
to the Number of People, fully
and usefully employed.</p>

<p>That every industrious Person adds to
the Wealth, and Support of a Nation; and
every Idler, detracts from both, by living
on the Labour of Others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>That it is the best Policy in any Government,
to encourage, and provide for
the full Imployment of the People; since
thereby, the Number, Wealth, Strength,
and Quiet of the Inhabitants are increased.</p>

<p>That the Gain, or Loss of any Nation
by Trade, is known, and determined by the
Proportion, which the Exports bear in Value
to the Imports. On this depends the
absolute Quantity of Money in a Nation;
the Relative Quantity of the several Species,
that composeth this Money, being ascertained
by the Value imposed on those Species;
either as it agrees with, or differs from
the Value set thereon by other Nations.</p>

<p>A Nation certainly loses by a Trade,
whose Exports are not compleatly manufactured,
and whole Imports are fully wrought.</p>

<p>A few Manufactures will serve to exchange
for great Quantities of the simple
Produce of the Earth. The Value of Manufactures,
being principally owing to Labour
and Art.</p>

<p>If upon these Principles, we examine
the State of the Trade of <i>Ireland</i>; I fear
we shall find it, in a very declining, and
ruinous Condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Exportations are made up of
Wool, Woorsted, Linnen, Yarn, Beef, Butter,
Cheese, Tallow, Hydes, Skins, and a
few other Articles.</p>

<p>We are not allowed to export our Wool
and Woorsted, but to a few Ports in <i>England</i>,
and are prohibited from sending thither,
or any where else, any other of our
Woollen Manufacture. Linnen, and some
tanned Hides are the only Commodities
we export, compleatly Manufactured; Yarn
and Woorsted may be accounted but as half-wrought;
Almost all the other Articles are
but little removed from the State, Nature
has given them to us, and have little or no
Labour or Art employed about them.</p>

<p>At the same Time, we export so liberally
the Growth of our Country, and so
little of our Manufactures, we may observe
all our Importations are of such Commodities,
as are not capable of farther Improvement;
such as <i>East-Indian</i> and <i>West-Indian</i>
Goods, Druggs, Wines, Spirits, Manufactures
of Wool, Silk, Linnen, Iron, Brass,
Glass, <i>&amp;c.</i> Nay, the common Produce of
almost all Countries, as Corn, Timber, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Fireing, are imported in great Quantities
to supply our Necessities.</p>

<p>By this Management of our Trade, we
maintain many Thousands in foreign Countries,
and drive Numbers of our own People
from us, or leave them to starve at
home, for Want of Imployment.</p>

<p>If to this View, we add that mighty
Drain of our Bullion, made by those Gentlemen,
who, having great Estates in this
Kingdom, choose to spend them any where,
rather than at home: We can not be at a
Loss, how to account for the Ballance of
Trade, running against us, for so many
Years past.</p>

<p>The most certain Way left to retrieve
our Affairs, is to lessen our Imports, and
to encrease our Exports, especially of Manufactures.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of the Linnen Manufacture,
by an unwearied Application
and uncommon Skill, have contributed
greatly to the Value of our Exports, by
the Advancement of the Linnen Manufactury.
And I don’t doubt but that in several
other Articles, divers Expedients and Means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
may be thought of, for promoting a greater
Consumption of our Own, and lessening
that or foreign Commodities; and as
one Instance, I shall beg Leave to propose
an Improvement in our Tannage, by which
I apprehend, we shall be enabled to Tan
with the Produce of our own Country all
the Hydes that now are Exported Raw;
and thereby increase the Value of our Exports,
employ many Thousands of our People,
and avoid the Necessity of Importing
Bark.</p>

<p>To set this Matter in a clear Light, I
shall lay down, in the first Place, the Export
of Green Hydes, and the Import of Bark,
in the seven following Years, for the Whole
Kingdom, as the same has been extracted
out of the Custom-House Books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next Place it is to be observ’d,</p>

<p>That Bark, according to its Goodness,
is sold from 6 to 10, and in some Years, 11
Shillings, the Barrel.</p>

<p>That Cow-Hydes weigh from 56, to
84 Pounds each; Bullock Hydes, weigh
from 84 to 140 Pounds each, and both are
sold from 15 to 21 Shillings, the hundred
Weight.</p>

<p>That Soles, are generally sold from 8
to 8 Pence half-penny the Pound.</p>

<p>That Hydes generally lose about half
their Weight, in Tanning.</p>

<p>From these Principles, when thrown
into mean Proportionate Quantities, it is
evident:</p>

<p>That the Quantity of Bark, annually
imported, is 50,000 Barrels, and the Value
21,000 Pounds.</p>

<p>That the Number of Green Hydes,
annually exported, are 80,000, and their
Value 57,000 Pounds.</p>

<p>That if these Green Hydes were tanned
before Exportation, their Value would
be 123,000 Pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Difference, arising from the
Different State of these Hydes, on Exportation,
is 66,000 Pounds, which Sum added
to the 21,000 Pounds, the Value of
the imported Bark, making in the whole
87,000 Pounds, must be accounted, as so
much gained to the Kingdom, should our
Tannage be effected by our own Produce
and Labour.</p>

<p>The Nations, that demand this Export
of those Green Hydes, are those, whose
black Cattle are not bred, in such Numbers,
as to supply their indispensable Demands;
Nor will their dry Hydes, which
they receive from their Settlements abroad,
admit a thorough Tannage; They, in hopes
of putting their Neighbours, who have a
Redundancy of Hydes, under a Necessity,
of parting with them unmanufactured, have
prohibited, by the severest Penalties, the
sending us any Bark. While we, on the
other Part, have not only complied with
this detrimental Export; but also have been
so regardless of our own Interest, as to permit
several Tanners, some from this City,
to go, and instruct them in an Art, they
almost were Strangers to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>English</i>, from a true Sense of the
Disadvantage of such a Trade, have subjected
the Exporter of a Green Hyde, to
the Penalties of 500 Pounds, and a Disability
to trade in Leather, ever after. <i>Ann.</i>
14. <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p>Such an Act, even in our present Circumstances,
may, by some, be thought adviseable
for us; Because, such Nations, as
now gladly receive our Green Hydes, finding
a Stop, put to their usual Supplies,
would be under a Necessity of receiving
our tanned Hydes, and selling us their
Bark. Leather being a Commodity, that
does not depend on the Fancy; but, is absolutely
requisite, not only to the Luxuries,
but also, to the Necessities of Mankind.</p>

<p>At present, Our Tanners find a great
Scarcity of Bark, except those residing in
some considerable Sea-Port-Town, and are
under just Apprehensions of a greater. Several
in the Country have been obliged to
lay aside their Pits, and take to other Imployments;
the usual Supplies failing. Our
Neighbours who will permit any Bark, to
be sent us, are in a Manner exhausted. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<i>American</i> Plantations are too remote to find
their Account, in sending any great Quantity.
The Produce of our Country is scarce
a twentieth Part of what is used in Tanning.
This renders our Tannage dear, and
often imperfect, so as not to serve a foreign
Market, to Advantage, and Reputation.</p>

<p>But if we had Materials, of our own
Growth, easy of Acquisition, and Propagation,
that would tan, in every Respect, as
well as Bark; were these Materials, as to
their Powers, well ascertain’d, and confirm’d
by a general Experience, the making an
Act, to prohibit the Exportation of Green
Hydes, would be judged by all to be Adviseable,
and Useful to the Kingdom.</p>

<p>When the apparent Qualities of Bark,
are considered; and that by it’s insinuating
into the Pores, and incorporating with the
Substance of the Hyde, it produces a Firmness,
Strength, and Consolidation of the
Parts; It is very surprizing, that other Materials,
of the same Apparent Qualities,
have so long remained neglected, and unapplied
to the same Uses; when the Consequence
is of such Moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tormentil</i>, and <i>Cinquefoil</i> Roots, are ranged
in the same Medical Class; have the
same apparent Qualities, especially the first,
in a more eminent, and evident Degree,
than Bark, it self.</p>

<p>On Tryal, they have answered beyond
Expectation: The <i>Cinquefoil</i> did not give
so good a Colour, as the <i>Tormentil</i>, which
in all Respects, as to Colour, Bloom, Substance,
Solidity, and Weight, in the Tanned
Hyde, compleatly answered, and in
much less Time, than when Bark, (even of
the best Kind, or Growth) is used.</p>

<p>Tho’, what is here asserted, is grounded
on several Years Experience, and confirmed
by the Opinion and Testimony of
Mr. <i>Philip Cooley</i>, Tanner, who from the
Beginning hath been concerned in the several
Tryals, and to whose Skill and Industry
a Part of the Subsequent is owing.
Yet to give the utmost Satisfaction, and as
I think my self in the strongest Manner
bound by the Encouragement, hitherto
given me, by the <i>House of Commons</i>, to render
the best Information I am able, in an
Affair of some Consequence to the Public,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I shall give a most faithful Account of the
Progress that has been made, and the Success
that hath attended this Way of Tanning
with relation to the Goodness of the
Leather, the Time, and Charge of Tanning,
and other Circumstances; and shall
add several Observations, with Directions
for finding, and propagating these Roots,
in great Plenty, that all Persons may be
encouraged to carry this Method of Tanning,
into a general Practice, which as it
will be for their private Advantage, so it
will not fail to promote the Public Benefit.</p>

<p>In Order to this, I shall in the first Place
beg Leave to place this Affair in the Light
it appeared in before the <i>Committee</i> of the
<i>House of Commons</i> of <i>Ireland</i>, to whom my
Petition was referred by the <i>House</i>, in
which Petition it was alledged, that I had
established a Method of Tanning, without
the Use of any Barks, to as great Perfection,
cheaper, and in less Time, than with
Bark, by Vegetables of our Natural Produce,
and of easy Culture.</p>

<p>The <i>Committee</i>, were pleased, for their
greater Satisfaction, to summon a Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Number of Tanners, Curriers, Shoemakers,
and others, to attend, to give their Testimony
in relation to the several Specimens,
and Proofs, that were to be laid before
them.</p>

<p>In respect to the Goodness of the Leather,
so tanned, the following Specimens
were exhibited.</p>

<p>Nᵒ. 1. A Calve’s Skin from the Ooze.</p>

<p>Nᵒ. 2. A Calve’s Skin, uncurryed.</p>

<p>Nᵒ. 3. A Calve’s Skin, curried: each
of these, when tann’d and dry’d, weighing
about three Pounds.</p>

<p>Nᵒ. 4. A Calve’s Skin, very strong and
large, when tanned and dryed, weighing
about Six Pounds.</p>

<p>Nᵒ. 5. Seven or Eight Pair of Soles, of
a Calve’s Skin, rais’d.</p>

<p>Nᵒ. 6. A Bend of a Bullock’s Hyde for
Harness.</p>

<p>These were all proved by <i>Thomas Cooley</i>
and <i>Patrick Shale</i> to be tanned without
Bark, and with the Roots.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Henderson</i>, Master of the Tanners,
said he was diffident of the Goodness of
the Specimens, that he should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
thoroughly satisfyed: had he known, how
the Leathers had proved, if worn, by some
Porters, or Chairmen. That the Colour
of Number 2, or 3, was not so good as
some tanned with Bark, producing a Calve’s
Skin curried, to compare with them, but
did own, all the Specimens were thoroughly
struck, and well tanned: That if they
were in a Shop, intermixt with Skins, tanned
by Bark, he could not distinguish them;
and that, what tanned Numb. 5 and 6,
would tann, Time and Quantity allowed,
the thickest Bullock’s Hyde.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dobson</i>, Tanner, affirmed the Specimens
were not well tanned, because they
did not come up to the Colour of the Skin
produced by Mr. <i>Henderson</i>, but in other
Respects, the Leathers appeared, to be as
good in their respective Kinds, as any tanned
with Bark.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Nicholas Gibson</i>, Master of the
Curriers, affirmed that the Skin produced
by Mr. <i>Henderson</i>, was of an Extraordinary
Colour; That there were not ten such in
<i>Dublin</i>; That the Difference in Colour was
but very small, and in regard even to Colour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
would choose those tanned by the Vegetables,
as soon as Mr. <i>Henderson</i>’s Skin;
That all the Specimens appeared to be very
well tanned, and that he could in no wise
distinguish them from Bark-Tannage.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Devereux</i>, Currier, being sent out,
returned, producing two Calves Skins tanned
by Bark, which he took indifferently,
and without choosing, from the next Currier’s
Shop. They were allowed by all,
to be of a general or common Colour; and
being compared were much exceeded by
the Specimens, and particularly, as to Colour.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Edmund Sheild</i>, Currier, said he
never saw better tanned Leather, than the
Specimens, that their Colour was very good
and, that what tanned Numb. 5. would
tann any Hyde, whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Brookfield</i>, Tanner, reported the Specimens
exhibited, were well tanned and
thoroughly struck; that neither He, or any
other could distinguish them, from Bark
Tannage; and that what tanned Numb. 5,
could not fail in any Tannage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Veckers</i>, Tanner, allowed the Specimens
to be very well tanned; and gave
it, as his Opinion, that what tanned Numb.
5 and 6, would tann the thickest Sole Leather.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>John Gades</i>, Shoemaker, after giving
his Testimony, that all the Specimens
appeared to be exceedingly well tanned,
produced a Shoe, made by him, of the
Leather of this Tannage, affirming the
Leather, wrought very well, and that the
Soles exhibited, under the Hammer, all
the Signs of extraordinary Leather.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ellis</i>, Shoemaker, reported the Specimens
were very well tanned: That, Leather
either dead, or highly tanned, would
never carry so beautiful a Colour as Leather
otherwise tanned. That, the Sole
Leather appeared to be very well tanned;
and that in his Opinion this Tannage,
would in every respect, answer the same
End, or Intentions, as Bark Tannage.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>James King</i>, Shoemaker, said all
the Specimens, were effectually tanned.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Richard Norris</i>, Shoemaker, produced
a Sole of this Tannage, beaten; asserting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he never saw so good a Sole of rais’d
Calve’s Skin, that it beat firm, solid, and
without spreading, or Fuzziness: which
are the distinguishing Characters of good
Sole Leather, he desired it might be cut
in several Places, that the Closeness, and
Firmness might be view’d, which accordingly
was done, and answering Expectation
was approved.</p>

<p>There were a great many other Tanners,
Curriers, and Shoemakers, who were
of the same Opinion. But considering,
their Testimonies, would be but so many
Repititions; I shall not recite them.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Richard Helsham</i>, Professor of Natural
Philosophy in <i>Trinity College</i>, said I
had communicated to him, what was used
in this Tannage, which appeared to be well
adapted to tanning, and would not fail to
give a sufficient Strength, and Rigidity to
the Fibres. Adding he wore a pair of
Shoes, the Upper Leathers of this Tannage,
daily for four Months, and being
willing to try the utmost of the Leather,
had new Soles put to them; that since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had worn them about a Month: showing
them, without any Cracks, or Defect.</p>

<p><i>Patrick Carrol</i>, produced two Slips of
curried Calf Skin; the one tanned by Bark,
the other by the Roots, each three tenths
of an Inch broad, and ten Inches long, the
first was the thickest, and weighed, a tenth
Part more than the other. He said, he
was present with several others, when it
broke, by a Weight of 129 Pounds being
hung to it; That the Slip of this new Tannage,
being tryed with the same Circumstances,
bore 29 Pounds more than the 129
Pounds, before it either yielded, or broke.</p>

<p>In respect to Time.</p>

<p>That the Specimens, Nᵒ. 1, 2 and 3
were tanned in five Weeks, Nᵒ. 4 in nine
Weeks, Nᵒ. 5 in four Months, without
any Hurry, extraordinary, or illegal Methods:
was proved by Mr. <i>Thomas Cooley</i>,
and <i>Patrick Shale</i>; on the other Side, it
appeared, that in tanning with Bark, from
three to five Months were required for
Calves Skins, from seven to nine were requisite
for Soles of rais’d Calves Skins, and
from ten to thirteen Months for Bullocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Hydes, which by this Tannage, may be
effected in nine or ten.</p>

<p>In regard to Cheapness.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Philip Cooley</i>, affirmed that six Pounds
of the Dry Roots, added to some old expended
Ooze, tanned Six Calves Skins,
three of which were produced under the
Nᵒ. 1, 2, and 3; and that he believed sixteen
Pounds would have done as much from
the first, or without any old Ooze.</p>

<p>In relation to the Cheapness.</p>

<p>Part of the Roots, I have used, I purchased
at three Farthings, the Pound; but
of late Years, and being willing to engage
the Privacy of the Gatherer; I have given
a Penny; they lose about a third in Drying:
Allowing these as Facts and taking it
at the dearest, less than five Shillings worth
of Roots, will go farther, than a Barrel
of the best Bark.</p>

<p>As to their Plenty and Propagation,
Dr. <i>Helsham</i> testified, they grew in great
Plenty as he had observed, in several Counties
of this Kingdom, and were very easily
propagated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. <i>William Stephens</i>, Botanic Professor
in <i>Trinity College, Dublin</i>, in his Examination
declared, that they grew in great Plenty
about <i>Dublin</i>, and in several Counties he
had observed great Quantities, chiefly on
Mountains, and barren Places: That, they
were easily to be propagated, in almost any
kind of Soil, and that he had some flourishing
in the Physick Garden, belonging
to the University.</p>

<p>The Resolutions, that the House entred
into <i>January 10</i>, might very well have sufficed
to have recommended a General Practice.
But to remove some Prejudices and
to obviate some false Representations, I
have impartially recited the several Facts
and Testimonies, on which they were
founded.</p>

<p>That all People may easily know and
find out these Plants, I shall here give a
Description; which though tedious, I hope
will be excused.</p>

<p><i>Cinquefoil</i>, in <i>Latin</i>, <i>Pentaphyllum vulgare</i>,
in <i>Irish</i>, <span class="irish">Tuigbeag</span> (<i>Tuigbeag</i>) <span class="irish">Tuigvear
Muirre</span> (<i>Tuigvear Muirre</i>) and in some
Counties, <span class="irish">Meagigh</span>, (<i>Meagigh</i>) is a Plant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
whose Roots are very long, about a Finger’s
Thickness, of a dark brown or reddish Colour,
and very astringent in Taste; the
Leaves are born at the Extremity of a
small Stem, five together, deeply indented
on their Edges, of an oblong Form and
hairy; on the Grand Stem, at the Nodes,
shoot forth several smaller, terminating
with a small Yellow Flower, composed of
six small Leaves surrounding a Number
of Threads, from whence ariseth a Cluster
of Seeds.</p>

<p>It flourishes in every Hedge, sandy,
loose and deep Soil: the Roots which are
to be preferred, are the thick, long, and
of the darkest Colour.</p>

<p><i>Tormentil</i>, or <i>Septfoil</i>, in <i>West Meath</i>,
called <span class="irish">Neauhnadis</span> (<i>Neauhnadis</i>) in <i>Ulster</i>,
<span class="irish">Menedin</span> (<i>Menedin</i>) or <span class="irish">Neauhnid</span>
(<i>Neauhnid</i>) in <i>Connaught</i>, <span class="irish">Levenet</span> (<i>Levenet</i>)
in the County of <i>Mayo</i>, <span class="irish">Fenede na
Muc</span> (<i>Fenede na Muc</i>) this Plant, hath a
thick, tuberous Root, of a reddish brown Colour,
sometimes covered with a black Skin,
of a very astringent Taste, and shooting out
many Fibres; the Leaves are generally seven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
set on the Extremity of a Foot Stalk,
of a dark Green Colour, deeply indented
on the Edges and hairy, from amidst them
ariseth several small weak Stalks, of a reddish
Colour, and hairy, about 12 or 18
Inches in Height, knotted; at every Knot,
or Joint, is a Foliage, and two or three
Foot Stalks, some bearing Leaves, and
one longer than the rest the Flowers consisting
of four Leaves, of a light Yellow
Colour, to which succeeds the Seeds; the
flower Cup, hath Eight Leaves, four large
and four small, the Root when Vigorous
sends forth several Runners, the Stalks of
which are of a reddish Colour, and hairy
that spread over the Ground; at every
Joynt, from one Part ariseth two or three
Stems, each bearing at the Extremity five
Leaves, from the other Part, descend several
Fibres that become Roots.</p>

<p>It grows almost every where, but chiefly
delights in mountainy, barren and shallow
Soils; the Roots seldom striking four
or five Inches deep. It hath been observed
by Dr. <i>Stephens</i>, to grow all along the
Banks of the <i>Doder</i>, from <i>Donore-Brook</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<i>Old Baun</i>, upon Roch Town Hills; it grows
on the Borders of a great Bog for several
Miles, by <i>Rathmullian</i> in the County of
<i>Meath</i>. In the County of <i>Wicklow</i>, Thousands
of Cart-Loads might be with Ease
collected; Nor do I know a Mountain or
Bog without Plenty of it.</p>

<p>In the Figure, (<i>a</i>) denotes the Root,
(<i>b</i>) the Flower in the Bud, (<i>c</i>) the Flower
expanded, (<i>d</i>) the Knob of Seeds, (<i>e</i>) the
Runners, (<i>f</i>) the Flower Cup. I have exhibited
but few of the Leaves, Stems, and
Runners to avoid Confusion.</p>

<p>It is observable, that from the Bark of
the Stalk of this Plant, at its breaking forth
from the Root, excrementitious Tubercles
or Knots, resembling Oak-Galls have been
often discovered, and like them are subservient
to the Propagation of Insects;
which, considering the extream nice, and
distinguishing Taste of those Animalculas,
may well be allowed as a Proof, that their
Juices are similar.</p>

<p>The Roots growing on Mountains are
small, strong, and often have a black Coat;
those that grow on the Sides of Loughs,
and in Bogs, are large, of a lighter Colour;
some I have had of the Latter, that have
weighed each above half a Pound.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>When you chose the Roots, prefer the
large, knotty Roots, that when broken
exhibit a blood red Tincture intermixt
with the Brown, and those that when cut,
leaves on the Knife a strong purple Colour.</p>

<p>The best Time for collecting these Roots
is in the Winter Season, or early in the
Spring, and tho’ the Seed-bearing Stalks,
and Foliage are decayed, yet there are several
Foot Leaves, that remain and direct
the Inquirer.</p>

<p>And tho’ these Plants grow wild all over
the Country, in such Plenty, as to be
more than sufficient to tann all the Hydes,
and Skins of the Kingdom; and little Apprehension
of a Deficiency, for in digging
up the Roots, there will be left some broken
Parts, some Fibres, which will Vegetate
and give a Supply. A common Root,
on a moderate Computation will produce
8 or 10 hundred Seeds, these shedding, and
dispersed by Winds, and other Accidents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
some will take Root, and carry on a Succession.</p>

<p>And in regard, it may be objected, that
the Trouble and Expence, in gathering
them, when in so dispers’d a Manner, would
be very great; and a constant Supply uncertain:
And because the Roots, if raised
in such Soils, as shall be found to agree
with them, would thereby become larger,
stronger, as well as cheaper, I have endeavoured
the Culture, especially of the <i>Tormentil</i>,
and with such Success, as to have
from each square Yard three Pounds weight
of the Roots.</p>

<p>An Acre contains 7,840 square Yards;
but, for Paths, Wastes, and inclosing, I
would allow 1,800 Yards, not to be employed;
As the first Year they will be little
more than fibrous, I would allow three
Years for their Growth, tho’, if another
Year was added, the Crop by an Increase
would sufficiently reward, not only as to
Quantity but Quality; as the best of Lands
are not required; I would state the Expence
of that Culture as follows,</p>

<p>Suppose each square Yard, should
produce but the Moiety of what before
was mentioned, and sold but at three farthings
the Pound, the Amount will be 27<i>l.</i>
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> from whence a Profit ariseth beyond
most of our Cultures, now in general
Use, and the Tannage may be accomplished,
at about a Moiety of the present Expence.</p>

<p>Probably, this Estimate of the Charge
and Profit, may not be so exact as to be
strenuously defended; but if defective, there
is Room enough for any reasonable Addition
or Deduction, without much Prejudice
to the Argument; different Soils, often one
and the same will be attended with different
Charges; The finer, the Earth is made, or
the more it is broken, before Planting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
better Vegetation succeeds; at first shooting
up of the Herbage, particularly where
the Ground is foul, houghing, or pulling
up the large Weeds, will be necessary, that
the Growth of the <i>Tormentil</i> may not be
chequed; in a little Time it will clear its
self. As the Roots run superficially, not
streeking at most 5 or 6 Inches in perpendicular
Depth, the Charge of digging them
up cannot be so much, as that which attends
Potatoes.</p>

<p>The Propagation may be effected by
planting the Crowns of the Roots, (that
Part, from whence the Herbage ariseth) in
either Autumn or Spring, in the same manner
as Horse Raddish, splitting the Crown,
so as to leave a Bud on every Slice, then setting
them in the Ground, about an Inch in
Depth and allowing each Set, 5 or 6 Inches
square of Ground. When you take up a
Plantation, you will have an Abundance
of small Roots that arose from the shedding
of the Seed, and from the Runners,
that will scarce be worth the Drying, but
very proper for Planting: If you cut from
either Extremity of the Root, a Piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
about half an Inch in Length, it will grow
very well. The whole Root, if cut into
such Pieces, may be planted. In all these
I believe the Charge of Planting might be
saved; if you scatter them before Harrow,
the passing of that over them, will cover
them with Earth sufficient; or at least, the
most Part of them.</p>

<p>You may Plant the Runners, as you do
Strawberries, in the mention’d Seasons and
Distances, and considering the Numbers of
fibrous Roots, already shot forth, it may
be allowed the speediest Method.</p>

<p>The Seeds ripen about <i>August</i> or <i>September</i>,
when ripe, they are of brownish Colour;
as they are very apt to shed, the Time
of ripening must be heedfully regarded; It
would be adviseable to cut the Hawm or
Herbage, a little time before the Seeds ripen,
laying it on a Cloth, or winnowing
Sheet in the Sun, when dry, rub the Seeds
out with your Hands, and separate them
from the Chaff. In <i>March</i> the Ground
being prepared, you may sow and harrow,
or rake them into the Ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cutting of the young Stems, if
planted in <i>May</i>, will grow.</p>

<p>The Roots when collected, are to be
washed very clean, from the Earth that
will remain with them, for otherwise, that
Dirt when in the Layers, settleth into the
Pores of the Hyde or Skin, and causeth
Numbers of Spots, and Discolourations.</p>

<p>In fair Weather, it not being a succulent
Root, they will sufficiently dry if spread
on a Floor, or a clean Part of the Field;
a little Wet, will in no case damage them.
In case of very wet Weather, and continued,
they may be Kiln dryed, in the same
Manner as Bark.</p>

<p>When dryed, they must be bruised or
ground, either more or less, according to
the Uses design’d, or to the Proportion you
require them to spend in. In case they
should not be sufficiently washt, when they
are pounded, or ground a little, it would
be adviseable to sift the Dirt, or Earth,
which by this Means is broken, and seperated
from them.</p>

<p>When thus prepared, you must proceed
in the same Manner, and lay away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
intirely, with the same Circumstances as
with Bark.</p>

<p>It hath often been objected, That if
this Method should obtain, Planting would
be discouraged, and so prejudice the landed
Interest. That it is used in the <i>Canary Islands</i>
and that though it may be done effectually
there, yet the Produce of our
Country might have Qualities very different,
or not exalted to such a Degree, as
to be of a requisite Force.</p>

<p>To these, I would answer.</p>

<p>That Bark would always bear a Price,
in Proportion to the Rate of what is substituted
in lieu thereof; It would be far
from being rendered useless, but only suffer
a Diminution in Value.</p>

<p>That Diminution would be more than
ballanced by the accelerated Growth, and
Worth of the Timber. At present we fall
our Woods so young, and at such improper
Seasons, on Account of the Bark, that the
Timber is neither so good, and little more
than fit for Ribberies, and Cabbins; whereas
otherwise, was the present Inducement,
the great Price of Bark diminished, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
should have full, and well grown Timber,
cut at a due Season, and proper for Edifices,
and Shipping.</p>

<p>The Improvement of those Lands that
now are unprofitable, or not far from such,
would be another Ballance, if not wholly,
yet in Part, to the apprehended Injury.</p>

<p>The Use of this Root hath not been
confined to the <i>Canaries</i>. The Reverend
Mr. <i>Lucas Jacobson Debes</i>, in his History of
the Islands of <i>Feroe</i> says Page 120, “Here
groweth a huge Quantity of <i>Tormentil</i>,
which the Inhabitants, having no Bark
of Trees to tan their Hydes with, make
Use of; God and Nature having revealed
to them the Dryness of that Herb,
so that they tan their Skins with it, and
therefore call it Bark.” And Page 271.
“The Men wear Shoes of Neats Leather,
tanned with the Roots of <i>Tormentil</i>.”</p>

<p>The first of these Islands, is in the Latitude
of 28, the other in 62. Yet we
find the same Roots used for the same
Purposes, though probably they may differ
in Degrees of Power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>A great Degree of Heat is not a Quality
requisite to the Perfection of all Vegetables.
<i>Saffron</i> in <i>France</i> exceeds the Produce
of <i>Spain</i>, as much as the little we
have in <i>Ireland</i> excells the Product of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>Our Temperate Climate seems in some
Degree, to be more adapted to Vegetables
of this Species of Power, than those that
are deemed hot. Our Bark is allowed to
excel the Bark of those warmer Climates,
as also our Timber.</p>

<p>It is a contested Point, whether the <i>Tormentil</i>
is not the Plant, the <i>Greeks</i> called
<i>Britanica</i>; probably so named from its plentiful
Growth in that Island.</p>

<p>One great Advantage, arising from this
Tannage should it become general, will
be, that it will give Imployment to a great
many Poor People, that will be set to work
in gathering, or raising such a Quantity
of those Roots, as will answer the present
annual Import of Bark; as also the Tannage
of some, if not the Whole of those Hydes,
we now export unwrought; besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
great Numbers, that will be employed in
the encreased Tannage.</p>

<p>Thus, with as much Brevity, as the
Nature of the Subject would admit of, I
have given a Narrative, of what I hope
will be as satisfactory, on a candid Perusal
as I am assured, it will be beneficial to the
Publick, in all its Consequences; if the Method
laid down be but pursued with common
Care, and Assiduity. It requiring no
greater Skill than what at present is used
in Bark Tannage; no Alterations in Forms,
or Utensils.</p>

<p>If the Instructions, laid down, should
appear to Any insufficient, or imperfect; I
shall always with Pleasure be ready to render
them, if in my Power otherwise. I
have made a Plantation, very near this
City, that if the Curiosity of Any should
prompt them to a farther Information, in
that Particular, they there may meet with
it. As this Tannage is constantly carried
on; it is open to the View of Any that desire
it. I have several Thousands of Pounds
weight of these Roots by me; I never
refusing the buying of any brought to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
If any Tanner wants, he may have it at
the Price, I gave to the Countryman, or be
directed where, or how to be supply’d,
until a Demand makes it a Market Commodity.</p>

<p>Our Necessities, and those daily encreasing,
first prompted to this Essay. The
Authority of Books, I have not relied on,
but a Series of Experiments that employed
several Years in the Pursuit. If I have
pointed out, or cleared from Incumbrances,
an advantageous Path that may lessen the
Import of Bark, extend our Tannage by
our own Produce, and give a Support to
any Number of Poor; I regard it in no
other Sense, than having done Part of that
Duty, I owe to a Country, which in Gratitude,
I would call mine.</p>

<p>I might justly incur a severe Censure, if
I should conclude, without testifying with
all due Acknowledgements, a grateful Sense
of my Obligations, to the Honourable <i>House
of Commons</i>, for the Vote they were pleased
to pass in my Favour, on the Report
of the <i>Committee</i>; that I had, after a full
Enquiry, answered the Allegations of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Petition; and for the Resolution, they entred
into, of giving all proper Encouragement
to so useful a Proposal.</p>

<p>Far from being insensible, that all new
Attempts of this Kind, are apt to subject
the Author of them, to the Name of a
Projector, and render him the Object of
Reproach and Suspicion; when I was fully
satisfied in the Facts, on which this Method
is grounded; I communicated it to
some Persons, who are as little liable to be
impos’d on themselves, as they are above
all Suspicion of imposing on others; under
the Sanction of whole Characters, such an
Imputation would at once be removed.
By their Directions I preferred my Petition,
and notwithstanding the Success was
not altogether such as they desired; I hope
they will not deny me the indulging a sincere
Gratitude, in particulary owning the
Obligations to them, who so warmly espoused
my Interest, grounded upon that of
the Nation. I shall venture to say no more,
than as I flatter my self they can clear me
from any Imputations of Sinister or Mercenary
Views; So I can promise my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Endeavours shall always tend to hinder a
Blush, for the Kind Representations, they
have been pleased to make in my Favour;
and that I shall always study to approve my
self what is my chiefest Ambition to be, and
what only intitles me to their Patronage; a
Pretender to no other merit, but Plain dealing.</p>

<p>I should have published this sooner, but
that I waited the Success of some repeated,
as well as new Experiments; all which
on the best Examination I am capable of
making, have tended to an intire Confirmation;
That the <i>Tormentil</i> Roots Tan all
Hydes and Skins as effectually, cheaper,
and in less Time than Bark, and is easily
propagated.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
